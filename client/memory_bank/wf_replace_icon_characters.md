# Workflow: Replace Icon Characters with Icon Library

## Current tasks from user prompt:

- Find all icon characters (like in get-toast.ts) across the project
- Replace character icons with proper icon library (lucide-react)
- Update get-toast.ts and all components/pages using character icons
- Ensure consistent icon usage throughout the project

## Plan (simple):

1. Read get-toast.ts to see current icon character usage
2. Search for icon characters across all files
3. Replace characters with lucide-react icons
4. Update imports and components accordingly

## Steps:

1. Analyze current icon character usage in get-toast.ts
2. Search project for similar icon character patterns
3. Replace with appropriate lucide-react icons
