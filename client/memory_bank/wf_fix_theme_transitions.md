# Workflow: Fix Theme Transition Smoothness

## Current tasks from user prompt:

- Fix theme switching transitions to be smoother
- Improve transition timing and easing
- Ensure all elements transition smoothly during theme change
- Optimize theme toggle animation

## Plan (simple):

1. Analyze current theme transition implementation
2. Improve global transition settings
3. Add better transition timing for theme changes
4. Optimize theme toggle component
5. Test smoothness across all components

## Steps:

1. Check current theme-toggle and global CSS
2. Improve transition timing and easing functions
3. Add prefers-reduced-motion support
4. Enhance theme switching delay and smoothness
5. Test all components during theme transition

## Things done:

- Created workflow plan
- Analyzed current transitions and identified issues
- Improved global transition timing:
    - Changed from 200ms to 400ms for smoother feel
    - Updated easing from cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) to cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94) for more natural motion
    - Extended theme-sensitive elements to 500ms
    - Added prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility
- Optimized theme toggle component:
    - Increased delays from 100ms/200ms to 150ms/300ms
    - Extended animation durations to 700ms for smoother transitions
    - Updated all easing functions to ease-out for better feel
    - Enhanced timing coordination between toggle states
- Updated all transition classes:
    - btn-transition: 0.25s with improved easing
    - theme-transition: 0.6s for full theme changes
    - scale-transition: 0.25s for hover effects
    - body transitions: 0.5s for background/color changes

## Things aren't done yet:

- Test the improved transitions in browser
- Fine-tune if needed based on user feedback
