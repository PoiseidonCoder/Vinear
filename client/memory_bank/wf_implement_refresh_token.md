# Workflow: Implement Refresh Token Mechanism

## Current tasks from user prompt:
- Implement refresh token mechanism instead of hydration fix
- Enable the commented refresh token code in axios interceptor
- Add refresh token to auth store and types
- Test the refresh token flow

## Plan (simple):
1. Add refresh token to auth types and store
2. Enable and fix the commented refresh token code
3. Add proper error handling and queue management
4. Test the complete authentication flow

## Steps:
1. Update auth types to include refresh token
2. Update auth store to handle refresh token
3. Implement refresh token interceptor logic
4. Add proper queue management for concurrent requests
5. Test the implementation

## Things done:
- Analyzed the commented refresh token code
- Identified it as a better solution than hydration fix
- Updated auth types to include refresh token
- Updated auth store to handle refresh token
- Implemented refresh token logic in axios interceptor
- Added queue management for concurrent requests
- Updated register and login hooks to handle refresh token

## Things aren't done yet:
- Test the solution thoroughly
- Verify refresh token endpoint exists on backend
- Test the complete authentication flow
