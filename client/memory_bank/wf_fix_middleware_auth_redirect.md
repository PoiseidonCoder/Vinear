# Fix Middleware Auth Redirect Workflow

## Current tasks from user prompt:

- Fix middleware to prevent authenticated users from accessing login/register pages
- Fix issue where user can briefly see login page before redirect

## Plan (simple):

- Review current middleware implementation
- Check auth cookie handling
- Ensure proper redirect logic for authenticated users
- Fix redirect timing issue

## Steps:

1. Analyze current middleware implementation
2. Check auth cookie configuration
3. Verify redirect logic for authenticated users
4. Update middleware order to prevent brief page display
5. Test the functionality

## Things done:

- Read current middleware.ts file
- Identified existing auth redirect logic
- Checked auth cookie configuration
- Updated middleware with new logic for private/auth paths
- Added proper locale handling for redirects
- Fixed middleware order to check auth pages FIRST
- Simplified matcher config to avoid conflicts

## Things not done yet:

- Test the auth flow

## Additional fixes made:

- Removed useAuthRedirect hook from login and register pages
- Cleaned up console.log statements from middleware
- Fixed import statements

## Notes:

- Updated middleware to include both private path protection and auth page redirect
- Uses "session-token" cookie name (consistent with auth-cookies.ts)
- Handles locale correctly for redirects
- Auth page check now happens BEFORE intl middleware processing to prevent brief page display
- Simplified matcher to catch all necessary routes without conflicts

## Key Changes Made:

1. Moved auth page check to be FIRST in middleware function
2. Simplified matcher config to use single comprehensive pattern
3. Added comment to clarify auth check happens before intl processing
